Though this program is primarily for Team Leads and Shift Leads, you must complete this program to be promoted to any leadership role within the store.\nTo be admitted to the program, you must have at least an 85 on your most previous evaluation and had a discussion with someone on the upper-leadership team.\nWhether you are on the path of becoming a Team Lead or a Shift Lead, the first two stages are identical. The third stage is where they differ, as Team Leads learn how to train and Shift Leads learn how to run shifts.\nIf a current Team Lead wishes to become a Shift Lead, they will not have to complete the program again. Instead, they only will be required to complete the third stage of the Shift Lead program, where they will refine their operational skills.\nBelow gives a brief explanation of what will be learned in each stage/what you will receive:"
